          By proceeding to view the Banks we are recommending for you to choose
          from â€“ it is understood as follows:
        </Heading>
        <ol>
          <li>
            1. The lending terms shown are, to the best of our knowledge, the
            key lending terms currently existing in the market.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            2. A bank may change its terms without notice and as such it is
            possible that this app has not yet been updated to revise all such
            changes.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            3. A bank may offer different terms to different customers based on
            the vehicle being purchased, your credit score and its specific
            lending policies.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>4. Each bank may have its own specific terms and conditions.</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            5. As such, the Bank Terms we show are illustrative only, not a
            commitment by a Bank to offer finance on the terms shown.
